Seki â€“ A powerful Go/Baduk/Weiqi Player for the modern age. Simple, Elegant, Compact and Intuitive.

## About
Seki is a Javascript library for reading, parsing, displaying, editing and replaying Go/Baduk/Weiqi game records.

It is a continuation of the defunct [ngGo](https://github.com/adamreisnz/ngGo) project, but has undergone a full rewrite to decouple it from Angular and update it to a modern modular code base using the latest Javascript features.

ngGo was originally based on the excellent work of Jan Prokop, who created the original javascript library [WGo.js](http://wgo.waltheri.net/). ngGo was based on WGo version 1.2.5, which was the latest version at the time of conversion.

All code has been refactored for the modern web. The code has also been improved to provide more flexibility and run more efficiently. All files have been tidied up in general, linted and extensively commented to provide for easy to read source code with a consistent formatting. Lastly, all the source code files have been organized in a logical manner and split up into sensible classes, making it easy to find all the different modules and functionality of this library.
